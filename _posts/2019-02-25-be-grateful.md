title: Be Grateful Before It's Too Late
excerpt: >-
  There are many situations in our lives that completely changes the world
  around us. We always curse the bad situations, but forget to be grateful for
  the good ones. These situations can be anything, starting from small things
  like a fight with your best friend or stumbling to handle stress at your job,
  to big things like finding the love of your life or getting that promotion in
  your job youâ€™d always dreamed of. It can be almost anything that has made you
  happy or sad.
