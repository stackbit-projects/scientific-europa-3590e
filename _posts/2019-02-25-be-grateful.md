title: Be Grateful Before It's Too Late
excerpt: >-
  There are many situations in our lives that completely changes the world
  around us. We always curse the bad situations, but forget to be grateful for
  the good ones. These situations can be anything, starting from small things
  like a fight with your best friend or stumbling to handle stress at your job,
  to big things like finding the love of your life or getting that promotion in
  your job you’d always dreamed of. It can be almost anything that has made you
  happy or sad.

*   There are many situations in our lives that completely changes the world around us. We always curse the bad situations, but forget to be grateful for the good ones. These situations can be anything, starting from small things like a fight with your best friend or stumbling to handle stress at your job, to big things like finding the love of your life or getting that promotion in your job you’d always dreamed of. It can be almost anything that has made you happy or sad.

    Many times, we don’t appreciate a good situation or a moment, unless we come across a bad one. We feel so bad about it that we don’t even remember the good things that have happened earlier. Every single thing seems to be bad, and eventually, we start hating life.

    Yes, I understand life is hard at times. But does cursing make it better? Nothing but worse will follow, and you won't know it. Let us decide to find at least one thing you can be grateful for. Will that make a difference? It will and if not, it won’t harm anything though. Anyways, cursing life does not make it any better.

    Life is all about the ups and downs. Even a heart rate falls before it rises, which technically means you are alive, isn’t it? So, what’s wrong if life does the same. It will show you the dark side to help you understand the bright side of happiness, and it will give you joy to forget your sorrows.

    We are never late to blame something when things go wrong. But are we quick enough to be grateful for something good that has happened? It does not always have to be a situation to be grateful for. I will list some of the things that you can be grateful for:

    Family
    Friends
    Job
    Relationship
    Your boss/manager/colleagues
    Food that you eat
    Water that you drink, and so on
