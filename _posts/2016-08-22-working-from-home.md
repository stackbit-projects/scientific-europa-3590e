title: It Matters That You Just Don't Give Up!
excerpt: >-
  How many times is it that you have failed? Once? Twice? Or did you just lose
  the count? Life is built upon our failures. It is what most people fail to
  understand. Every time we would try something, does not mean we will excel at
  it in a single try. It is said that "who has never failed, has never tried".
