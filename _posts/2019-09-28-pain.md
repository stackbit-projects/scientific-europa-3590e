  What is Pain?!

  Pain is your mom refuses to buy you a toy that you fell in love at first
  sight. Pain is you tried to get good grades in school and felt short for few.
  Pain is you graduated but still don't have a job. Pain is you have a job but
  your boss pisses you off even if you work harder.

What is Pain?!

Pain is your mom refuses to buy you a toy that you fell in love at first sight.
Pain is you tried to get good grades in school and felt short for few.
Pain is you graduated but still don't have a job.
Pain is you have a job but your boss pisses you off even if you work harder.
Pain is not finding someone to talk to let your heart out.
Pain is you have someone but can't share your real feelings.
Pain is you are alone and unaware of why you have this pain in your heart!
