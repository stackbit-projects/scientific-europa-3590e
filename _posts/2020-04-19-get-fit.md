title: Get Fit from the Inside, before you want to Get Fit on the Outside
excerpt: >-
  Getting straight to the point, this is not a fitness article nor a fitness blog. I am not going to advise you on what to eat or what to not! I don’t have that expertise. It’s true that I am a fitness freak—not to a level that I hit the gym every day for two hours. It has been a couple of years since I am not even going to the gym.
